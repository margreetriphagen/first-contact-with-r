Conceived by: Emma Beauxis-Ausselet / Digital Society School
Trainers: Emma Beauxis-Ausselet and Sjoukje Goldman / Center for Market Insights
Facilitator: Margreet Riphagen / Digital Society School


DESCRIPTION
Start programming with R without headache! You will learn to handle datasets and make neat visualizations with just a few lines of code. Within two days, you will be able to inspect datasets, manipulate them, and plot nice graphs to show your results. We will work with datasets related to the green economy. R is a very accessible programming language, so don’t be shy!

What is R? Why use it?
Read datasets of different format (CSV, spreadsheet, JSON, PDF, maybe more)
Inspect datasets (dataframe and datatable formats, filter columns and rows, browse rows with loops).
Make simple visualisations.
Export datasets & visualisations.
Data quality issues (missing data, provenance, sampling issues, biases)

Basic statistics (with extra visualisations)
Basic data manipulations (with extra visualisations)
TRAINERS
Emma Beauxis-Aussalet – My background includes design, engineering and research. Combining these can support great societal developments and I’m delighted to develop their synergy at DSS. I love gaining and sharing knowledge, having crazy ideas and exploring hidden corners. My PhD topic was classification uncertainty, where many hidden corners need more attention.
Sjoukje Goldman – My background includes marketing strategy, cross-border e-commerce and cross-cultural research. Currently I am doing a PhD at Vrije Universiteit and at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences. I have a strong preference for quantitative research and I use multi-group structural equation modeling in my PhD to gain a better understanding about the complexity of factors involved when shopping and selling online across national borders.
